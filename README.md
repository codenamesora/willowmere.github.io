# Willowmere — Responsive Shop & Cafe (Demo)

This is a lightweight responsive website template for **Willowmere**, a woodland-inspired shop & café with a whimsical cottagecore/forestcore aesthetic.  
Owner: **Sora & Co.**

## What's included
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/style.css` — styles (uses Playfair Display & Quicksand via Google Fonts)
- `js/main.js` — client-side behaviour: cart (localStorage), testimonials, carousel, feedback form
- `assets/` — placeholder images and simple illustrations
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use
1. Unzip the project.
2. Push to GitHub or open `index.html` locally.
3. The site is fully static — cart, testimonials, and feedback are stored in the browser's localStorage.

## Notes
- Replace images in `assets/` with your real photos. Filenames used in HTML/JS are `hero.jpg`, `placeholder1.jpg`, `placeholder2.jpg`, `placeholder3.jpg`, and product images `product1.jpg` ... `product4.jpg`.
- The checkout button simulates checkout and clears the cart. Integrate a payment gateway for real transactions.

Enjoy! — generated for Sora & Co.
